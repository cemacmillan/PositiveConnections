من منا هو الأعلى
بعد أن لم أنتهي من تسلقي
سأخبرك إذا رأيتك أسفل مني
تكريمك بالتحية المناسبة .


Could someone who really speaks Arab tell me if I have the correct tone here? It should come across as it does when one says: "Ya Effendi" and means nothing of the sort.

The context is a morning after poem. In the end, having known me, they felt they were too good for me (they imply they are _above me_)

I accepted this in good cheer, and am laughing about it again as I write this.

This is _not_ a settling score thing. I'm just trying to finish or, be satisfied with a few poems that might get my name on them. In French the same concepts convey an entirely different meaning (not fit for this venue).
I'll just give her a copy of the print edition. :)
