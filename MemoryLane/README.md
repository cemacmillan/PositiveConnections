Hi! My name is Ewen and I'm addressing a fellow reader of READMEs it would seem.

I make stuff for games, artificial organisms and agents, and have a complete life outside of these things.

I've started journaling through this directory the process of what goes on when one commits enormous amounts
of time to an oddball activity like writing mods for games.

I'll dump unused but interesting code, poems, anecdotes in this directory.
