<h2>Customization and Hardcore Mode:</h2>

Positive Connections is designed with flexibility in mind. You can adjust the frequency of social interactions or even disable them entirely via the mod settings. 

For players seeking a more immersive experience, enabling [b]Hardcore Mode[/b] will disable all in-game notifications about these interactions, leaving only the interaction bubbles (if enabled) visible. This mode is perfect for those who want to maintain focus without being interrupted by messages, while still benefiting from the positive social dynamics the mod introduces.
