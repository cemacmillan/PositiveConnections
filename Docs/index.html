    <h1>Positive Connections</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Are you tired of colonies where hostility dominates among your colonists? Despite facing and overcoming many shared challenges, do they still view each other merely as <em>acquaintances</em>?</p>
    <p>If so, <strong>Positive Connections</strong> is the mod you've been looking for.</p>

    <h2>Seven New Interactions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compliment:</strong> Pawns express genuine appreciation for each other's skills and qualities.</li>
      <li><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Reward your pawns for sharing knowledge, fostering a culture of learning and growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Gift Giving:</strong> Strengthen bonds by exchanging thoughtful gifts, promoting camaraderie.</li>
      <li><strong>Mediation:</strong> Help settle disputes and conflicts peacefully, encouraging harmony.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared Passions:</strong> Bond over mutual hobbies and interests, uniting your colonists.</li>
      <li><strong>Discuss Ideology:</strong> Foster understanding and empathy through meaningful conversations about beliefs.</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> A kind pawn, or one in a good mood, will check on another who isn't doing well, offering support after the harsh experiences of the Rim.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While rivalries, insults, and moments of indifference still happen, colonists who can build positive connections will tend to do so, leading to a more harmonious colony. Some interactions may even occur with pawns from other factions, possibly improving diplomatic relations (note: effects on relations are partially implemented).</p>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>This mod doesn't add any new graphics. The events are reflected through messages in the upper left-hand corner, as well as in the pawn's interaction log, memories, and mood buffs.</p>
    <p>Interactions may cluster, especially early on, but this is a transient effect of pawns feeling inspired and initiating new interactions. Also, note that "gifts" are ephemeral objects and won't appear in your pawn's inventory.</p>

    <h2>Playtesting and Compatibility</h2>
    <p>This mod has been playtested for many thousands of hours. However, bugs may still occur, and your reports and suggestions are appreciated.</p>
    <p><strong>Combat Extended:</strong> Compatible.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I getting a red error about Storytelling?</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> Fixed! This bug shouldn't occur anymore.</li>

      <li><strong>Q:</strong> Where are the gifts my colonists are giving each other?</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> Gifts in <em>Positive Connections</em> are virtual. It's the thought that counts.</li>

      <li><strong>Q:</strong> Does this mod interact with other mods?</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> No, this mod uses simple interactions and is agnostic to other mods or DLC (except for our own mods).</li>

      <li><strong>Q:</strong> What does the gender adjustment switch do?</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> It equalizes the chances of men and women initiating relationships. This is now corrected in the base game, but we've kept the option for nostalgia.</li>

      <li><strong>Q:</strong> Does this make the game too easy or hardly change anything?</li>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> This depends on your play style. You can adjust interaction frequency from 1/4 to 10x via mod settings. The recommended value is 1. <em>Positive Connections</em> might also encourage you to explore more challenging difficulty levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Bugs and Issues</h2>
    <p>Bugs are a natural part of software development. Please report any issues in the appropriate discussion thread. Your feedback helps improve the mod!</p>

    <h2>Final Notes</h2>
    <p>Check the change notes for detailed updates. Recently, we've adjusted interaction frequency based on colony size and reactivated some interactions that had become rare. Version 1.4 is now fully supported.</p>
